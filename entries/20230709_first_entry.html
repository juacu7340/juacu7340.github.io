        <h1>(9-July-2023) First Entry</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my first blog entry.</p>
        <!-- <p class="text-container"></p> -->
        <p class="text-container">I'm a junior software developer, always looking to learn new things, and sharing what I learn with friends.</p>
        <p class="text-container">Recently I started learning a new programming language, called <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">Zig</a>. I wanted a way to keep track of the things I learn, and also share these same things, so I thought about writting a blog page, and maybe who knows, this can grow into other topics that aren't Zig or programming related.</p>
        <p class="text-container">A little about me, my name is JÃºlio and online I currently go by the name juacu7340, but I've had many other nicknames. I'm from Portugal and as the time of writting this document I'm 23 years old. I am both working as a software developer and also finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My first contact with programming was in middle school, and the first programming language I was taught was C++.</p>
        <p class="text-container">I am by no means an expert in any area, I still consider I have a lot to learn (and I'm always eager to learn and share the things I learn along the way), but I have done a bunch of projects as I was learning and discovering new things, some of which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/juacu7340" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>, others will probably never see the light of day.</p>
        <p class="text-container">I was always curious about low level stuff, even if I didn't get nowhere with them. This curiosity allowed be to learn things that aren't normally taught in colege classes, and expanded my understanding of the digital world.</p>
        <p class="text-container">My current hobbies at the time of writting this document consist of doing exercise (I workout at home during the week and on weekends I go swimming and practise boxing with some friends), learning Russian (I'm very passionate about the Russian culture and mentality, plus in my opinion the cyrillic alphabets just look cool :) ), playing piano and guitar and reading on local poetry and philosophy.</p>
        <p class="text-container">So as a recap, the goal of this blog is for me to share with friends and the world I guess the things I learn, as I learn them, to keep track of the things I learn and to just experiment with the world of blogging. I hope you enjoyed reading my first blog post, hopefully I keep posting new ones in the future.</p>
