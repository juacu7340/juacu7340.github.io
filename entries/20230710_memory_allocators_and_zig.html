        <h1>(10-July-2023) Memory Allocators and Zig</h1>
        <!-- <p class="text-container"></p> -->
        <p class="text-container">Today I finished watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHWiDx_l4V0&ab_channel=ZigSHOWTIME" target="_blank">Benjamin Feng talk about memory allocators</a> and how that concept is used in the Zig programming language. I also went and read more about the memory allocators on the <a href="https://ziglearn.org/chapter-2/#allocators" target="_blank">ziglearn website</a>, and talked with some members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/zig" target="_blank">Zig Discord community</a>.</p>
        <p class="text-container">This was very eye-opening for me, as I always took a memory allocator as something granted, like, for example, in C I would use <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html" target="_blank">malloc</a> to do my allocations, and to me, malloc was THE way of allocating heap memory (in the C programming language, other languages have others, for example C++ also has the new memory allocator, etc).</p>
        <p class="text-container">What this talk and the following research I did on the topic taught me, was that the OS has all the memory, and the OS does not see bytes of memory, rather he sees memory as pages, and so, if we want X amount of memory, we would ask the OS to map or allocate a page aligned number of bytes that we could use (via a syscall). Memory allocators all have to do this internally, but what they do on top of that is, they manage the memory in that page (or pages), so that we don't have to either manage the memory ourselves (this process is often called "bookkeeping"), or we don't have to keep asking the OS for a page of memory every time we want to allocate something on the heap (this would also be very wasteful as you can imagine, as one page usually sits at around 4Kb, so if you wanted to allocate something as small as 1 byte, you would have a bunch of extra memory you were not using, for each allocation you would ask the OS).</p>
        <p class="text-container">Regarding the ways we can allocate memory, the ones I know about are either using a allocator like malloc, using syscalls to allocate page aligned bytes, mapping device memory into our process, abuse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_overcommitment" target="_blank">overcommit</a> (if the system allows overcommit), or you could even allocate memory via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O" target="_blank">MMIO</a> to external hardware, so that you could store things outside of RAM. I also heard something about using <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#wasmMemoryGrow" target="_blank">wasm to grow memory</a>, which I guess the goal is to increase the modules memory capacity so that we can allocate bigger amounts of memory than the amounts we could initially. This last method would, of course, be specific to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> programs thought.</p>
        <p class="text-container">The Zig standard offers us a general purpose allocator, but it is not the only allocator the standard has to offer. There are several more, each with different strategies that we should use depending on our program needs. Usually, when we code in C, we use malloc for everything heap-allocation wise. This works, of course, but we could be taking advantage of other memory allocation algorithms and strategies that other allocators use. You can read about each of them on the <a href="https://ziglearn.org/chapter-2/#allocators" target="_blank">ziglearn website</a>.</p>
        <p class="text-container">I find this concept to be so cool since it allows us to adapt what we use in terms of the memory allocator to our program needs, and profit (speed wise and memory footprint wise) from it.</p>
        <p class="text-container">I plan on making a memory allocator in Zig myself, probably something very dumb, just as a exercise and to learn a thing or two along the way. If I do get around to doing that, I will make a blog entry about the journey.</p>
