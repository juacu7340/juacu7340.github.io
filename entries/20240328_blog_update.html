        <h1>(28-Mar-2024) Blog Update</h1>
        <!-- <p class="text-container"></p> -->
        <p class="text-container">So a lot has changed since my last blog post. I kind of stopped making blog posts since I was caught up with work at the time, but now that will no longer be a problem since I no longer work for the company I was at. I am now focusing on finishing my bachelor's degree in computer science and thinking about pursuing a master's degree in the same field.</p>
        <p class="text-container">Hopefully, I will now have more time I can dedicate to personal projects and more blog posts. I would really like to get this going since I think it will be interesting to look back at this at some point in the future and see what I was up to. Maybe even one day make a blog post so interesting that people refer to it; now, that would be something.</p>
        <p class="text-container">I'm still learning about Zig. I stopped at about the same time I stopped making blog posts and I picked it up from zero pretty recently (since I forgot basically everything). But this time I will start making more small projects with Zig since I personally believe that is the only way for me to actually learn something properly. Reading about it and not practicing does not prove to be an effective way to be proficient at something, atleast for me.</p>
        <p class="text-container">The projects I am currently making time to work on (must not forget to focus on the degree; hopefully I only have one more year till completion after this current one) are all in Zig. One is trying to go as far as I can in the <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html" target="_blank">Ray Tracing in One Weekend</a> project (more like Ray Tracing in a few months for me lol), and the interesting part about it is that I'm doing it all in comptime, which is a very interesting aspect of the Zig language (<a href="https://github.com/juacu7340/rtowz" target="_blank">repo</a> if you're curious about what the code looks like). The other project is actually a tool (also in Zig) to generate the HTML for my blog posts, but that will most likely come a little later since I'm still not set on how I want things to look.</p>
        <p class="text-container">Besides that, I'm sick at the time of writing this, so there's that. Hopefully I'll make another blog post about something interesting soon (maybe math-related since I have a few things written down). See ya!</p>
